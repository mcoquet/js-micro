# js-micro
A pluggable RPC framework for microservices

An attempt at bringing the simplicity and power of the go-micro framework to node.js.

## Compatibility

js-micro is meant to keep compatibility with go-micro so that service developers can easily choose between developing a service in node.js or Go. Other languages can also be supported by using the Go Micro sidecar.
